# Prompt Injection Research

This repository documents research, experiments, and insights related to **prompt injection vulnerabilities** in large language models (LLMs). The goal is to better understand how these attacks work, explore real-world implications, and experiment with potential defenses.

Prompt injection is a growing concern in the field of AI safety and security. As LLMs are increasingly integrated into products and user-facing tools, ensuring robustness against prompt-based manipulation becomes critical.

## 🔍 Areas of Focus

- Identifying common types of prompt injection attacks  
- Analyzing how and why models comply with malicious or obfuscated instructions  
- Testing behavior under chained logic and recursive input patterns  
- Experimenting with mitigation strategies (e.g., filtering, prompt hardening, chain-of-trust design)

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Methods

- Custom testing environments for controlled experiments  
- Prompt chaining, temperature variation, and role manipulation  
- Observational logging and behavior tracking based on input-output relationships

---

## 🚧 Status

This is an **active research log**. Notes are updated regularly as I explore new techniques, analyze behavior patterns, and simulate attack scenarios.
